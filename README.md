##Problem
Looking through the [RIPTA website](http://www.ripta.com/), there was no place where rider can review their experience with RIPTA. 

Today with the sharing economy, businesses such as UBER, Lyft, AirBnB and more have excelled because of the power of the review.

One way in which to improve services for users and increase usership is through the review.

It is a way in which user pain points can be discovered to assist in business decisions, while also building trust with the customer. 

Kristen McCormick of [PropelMarketing.com](http://propelmarketing.com/blog/2016/power-online-customer-reviews/), wrote a great article on the power of the review.

## The Solution
RIPTA reviews is an easy to use seamless application to provide users a way in which to provide feedback about their ride that day.

Users can view previous reviews and provide their own if they wish.

The user can grade their experience on a scale of 1 - 5 stars in 5 categories:

- Overall experience
- Timeliness
- Cleanliness
- Friendliness
- Safety

These 5 categories were chosen for factors that are within the control of the service providers, as well as factors of most concern of customers.

The review will also provide a section for an optional comment to provide better clarity to the experience.

## Reach Opportunities
Additional features that can be added to this application:

- additional data added to the model from RIPTA's api to give feed back to management about where bad reviews occured, on which bus, and determine trends from drivers/equipment that under perform.

- a button to notify the driver that a rider is feeling uncomfortable/unsafe from a fellow rider, so that the driver is aware of potential safety concerns.

- make this application go mobile and be apart of a Transit like RIPTA app that provides bus location services in real time, knows when a user has left it's ride and asks instantly for user feedback.
